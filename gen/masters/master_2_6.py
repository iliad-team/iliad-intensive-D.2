r'''
When we train an agent with reinforcement learning, we communicate what we want it to do through a reward function. Today is about the two most important ways this can go wrong:

1. **Specification gaming** (also known as **reward hacking** or **goal misspecification**): the agent finds a way to achieve high reward that doesn't match the behaviour the reward designer intended. The reward function is optimised, but the *intent* behind it is not, as the reward function was not a perfect specification of the desired behaviour.

2. **Goal misgeneralisation**: the agent learns a goal that is consistent with the reward function *on the training distribution*, but which comes apart from the intended goal under distribution shift. The agent remains capable in the new environments, it just capably pursues the wrong thing.

Goal misgeneralisation is the more subtle of the two: even if you could perfectly specify a reward function that fully encapsulates all of the desires you have of the agent, the agent internally might still learn the wrong thing, and from a black-box perspective there is no way to tell the difference between the two (while on the training distribution).

We'll explore both of these failure modes hands-on, in a simple grid-world environment called the **pottery shop**: a small robot shares a shop floor with fragile urns and piles of broken shards, and we'd like it to clean the shards up without smashing anything in the process. You'll train agents with PPO, watch them learn to hack a naively-designed reward function, fix the specification using **potential shaping** and penalties, and then discover that even a well-specified reward function doesn't protect you from goal misgeneralisation when the deployment environment is out of distribution.

Unlike the previous days, today is not about implementing an RL algorithm.
An implementation of PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) is provided for you
for training. Instead, today you'll be working one level up: 
designing **environments** and **reward functions**, 
and studying the behaviour of the agents they produce.

## Content & Learning Objectives

### 1️⃣ Environments

We introduce the environment we'll be working with today: the pottery shop.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> - Understand how the pottery shop environment is implemented as batched tensor operations
> - Build intuition for the dynamics of the environment

### 2️⃣ Reward Functions

We introduce the third element of reinforcement learning, the reward function, and use the provided PPO implementation to train an agent in the pottery shop.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> - Interpret a reward function: what behaviour does it incentivise, and what behaviour was it *meant* to incentivise?
> - Train an agent with the provided PPO implementation
> - Interpret a trained agent's behaviour, and spot when it diverges from the designer's intent

### 3️⃣ Specification Gaming

The agent you just trained doesn't do what the reward designer had in mind. 
We diagnose the problem quantitatively using reward functions as *behavioural probes*, 
then fix the specification with potential shaping and an urn-breaking penalty.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> - Recognise specification gaming / reward hacking when you see it
> - Write reward functions that act as behavioural probes for misbehaviour
> - Understand and implement **potential shaping**, a way to add hints to a reward function 
without allowing the agent to reward hack.
> - Combine shaping terms and penalties into a fixed specification, and verify the fix

### 4️⃣ Generalisation

We move from a single fixed layout to a *distribution* of procedurally generated layouts, and train an agent that has to generalise across them.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> - Understand generalisation in RL as a special case of generalisation in machine learning
> - Train an agent on procedurally generated environments
> - Probe how a trained policy behaves on layouts it has never seen

### 5️⃣ Goal Misgeneralisation

The generalising agent has learned to carry shards... to where the bin *used to be*. We pin down this example of goal misgeneralisation, measure it, and explore the role of the training distribution.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> - Understand the definition of goal misgeneralisation, and the distinction between the intended objective and the behavioural objective
> - Write a reward function encoding the behavioural objective, and use it to demonstrate goal misgeneralisation quantitatively
> - Understand how broadening the training distribution can fix goal misgeneralisation — and why this isn't always available in practice

### ☆ Bonus

Theoretical and open-ended extensions: proving that potential shaping preserves the ordering over policies, finding situations where breaking an urn is still worth it, and more.

## Pottery shop: a simple environment

Here is a picture of an environment called "pottery shop".

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matomatical/reward-lab/main/environment.png" width="480">

Pottery shop is an example of a grid-world environment, where everything plays out on a finite grid of positions (in this case, a 6 by 6 grid).

This grid world contains various objects:

* **Urns** : the products of the pottery shop.
* **Shards** : some urns have been broken, leaving behind piles of shards.
* **A bin** : there is a bin in the top-left corner that stores shards.
* **A robot** : there is a small blue robot who can move around the grid, pick up shards, carry them around, and drop them (e.g., into the bin). If the robot crashes into one of the urns, the urn will break, creating a new pile of shards.

The pottery shop environment is implemented in the source file `part6_goalmisgen/potteryshop.py`. Some relevant snippets of code are as follows.

### Environment layout

Pottery shop actually refers to a family of environments of different sizes and with different initial configurations of objects. We represent such an environment as an `Environment` dataclass as follows:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Environment:
    init_robot_pos: Int[Tensor, "... 2"]
    init_items_map: Int[Tensor, "... world_size world_size"]
    bin_pos: Int[Tensor, "... 2"]
```

In particular, the fields are as follows:

* `init_robot_pos` contains the row `init_robot_pos[..., 0]` and column `init_robot_pos[..., 1]` grid coordinates of the spawn position of the robot.
* `bin_pos` similarly contains the row `bin_pos[..., 0]` and column `bin_pos[..., 1]` grid coordinates of the spawn position of the bin.
* `init_items_map` is a `(N, N)` tensor where `N` is the size of the grid world. The contents of the tensor map to the presence of shards or urns in the respective grid squares.

The following enumeration type explains how to interpret the numbers in `init_items_map`.

```python
class Item(enum.IntEnum):
    EMPTY = 0
    SHARDS = 1
    URN = 2
```

The coordinates in `init_robot_pos` and `bin_pos` should range from `0` to `world_size-1`, and the values in `init_items_map` should all be `0`, `1`, or `2`. All tensors should have dtype `torch.long`.

(The `"..."` in the type annotations is because the same class is also used to represent a *batch* of environments, with a leading batch dimension on every field — more on this in section 4️⃣.)

### Environment state

The environment object encodes the initial configuration of the pottery shop. But once we start taking actions, the state will change. At any time, the current state of the grid world is represented by the following dataclass.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class State:
    robot_pos: Int[Tensor, "B 2"]
    bin_pos: Int[Tensor, "B 2"]
    items_map: Int[Tensor, "B world_size world_size"]
    inventory: Int[Tensor, "B"]
```

The fields `robot_pos`, `bin_pos`, and `items_map` are the dynamic versions of `init_robot_pos`, `bin_pos`, and `init_items_map` from the environment configuration.

What's new is `inventory`, an integer that represents what kind of item the robot is carrying. This is initially `Item.EMPTY`, but changes to `Item.SHARDS` if the robot picks up a pile of shards (and changes back to `Item.EMPTY` if the robot drops the shards).


### Agent actions

The agent is responsible for controlling the robot as it moves around the grid. In each interaction, the agent sees the current state, and then chooses what the robot should do from the following options.

```python
class Action(enum.IntEnum):
    WAIT = 0 # do nothing
    UP = 1 # move up
    LEFT = 2 # move left
    DOWN = 3 # move down
    RIGHT = 4 # move right
    PICKUP = 5 # pick up item
    PUTDOWN = 6 # drop held item
```

### Environment methods

So much for defining the data types involved, the actual implementation of the environment logic takes place inside the methods of the environment class. The two most important methods are the following:

* `def reset(self, num_rollouts: int | None = None) -> State`: Initialises a batched `State` (for a single environment, `num_rollouts` parallel copies of the initial state).

* `def step(self, state: State, action: Int[Tensor, "B"]) -> State`: Takes the current (batched) state and the agent's actions (one per environment in the batch) and returns the resulting state of the environment (for example, moving the robot, updating its inventory, smashing urns).

We encourage you to skim the implementation in `part6_goalmisgen/potteryshop.py` --- the environment dynamics are about 60 lines of (heavily commented) tensor operations, and reading them is a good way to make sure you understand exactly how the world works before you start designing reward functions for it.

You can **[play the pottery shop in your browser](https://iliad-team.github.io/iliad-intensive-D.2/play.html)** to get a feel for the dynamics (move the robot around, smash urns, pick up shards and bin them) before you start designing reward functions for it.

Below we instantiate an instance of the pottery shop environment.
We can see the `Environment` object requires the following arguments:

* `init_robot_pos`: the initial position of the robot
* `init_items_map`: the map of all the location of objects in the environment
    - `0` represents an empty grid square
    - `1` represents a pile of shards
    - `2` represents an urn
* `bin_pos`: the position of the bin

## Reward Functions

A typical formulation of the goal of reinforcement learning algorithms is, given an **environment**, 
a **reward function**, and a **discount factor**, find a **policy** that **maximises expected return** (taking the expectation over the stochasticity in the initial state distribution, the transition distribution, and the policy itself).

## The reward hypothesis

Reward functions play a central role in the discipline of reinforcement learning. Their centrality is driven by the following hypothesis, called the **reward hypothesis:**

> "That all of what we mean by goals and purposes can be well thought of as maximization of the expected value of the cumulative sum of a received scalar signal (reward)."
>
> — Richard Sutton, [The reward hypothesis](http://incompleteideas.net/rlai.cs.ualberta.ca/RLAI/rewardhypothesis.html)

The reward hypothesis essentially claims that, regardless of what kind of purposes we want a system to fulfil, we can sensibly formulate that behaviour as the maximum expected return for *some* reward function. Once we find the right reward function, then we just need to apply a reinforcement learning algorithm to find a policy with the behaviour we desire.

While there is some debate in the field as to the extent to which the reward hypothesis is true in its maximal form (that maximisation of scalar returns covers *all* goals and purposes), it is certainly true that:

* There are some AI problems where finding the right reward function has allowed us to specify behaviours that were infeasible to specify imperatively (e.g. by programming, as in classical software engineering) or even declaratively (e.g. by generating labelled examples, as in supervised learning), with the most notable example being computer Go playing and recent examples of frontier reasoning models.

* This possibility has driven a substantial portion of interest in the field of reinforcement learning, with some seeing reinforcement learning as a key component of the likely path to human-level and super-human AI in the future.

Of course, it remains to find the right reward function!

## Interpreting a reward function

Here is a reward function. Note that it operates on *batched* transitions, like everything else today: `state` and `next_state` are batched `State`s, `action` is an integer tensor of shape `(B,)`, and the result is a float tensor of shape `(B,)` containing one reward per transition. The pattern `state.items_map[batch, rows, cols]` is just standard integer-array indexing, gathering the item under each environment's robot.
This allows us to run several copies of the environment in parallel on the GPU, ideal for training
RL agents at scale efficiently.

### Exercise - interpret this reward function

> ```yaml

> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

Study the reward function above and answer the following questions (`&` represents elementwise 'and' for tensors):

1. Describe the set of all rewards that the reward function can attain, and the kinds of transitions for which the reward function attains each of these rewards.

2. What kinds of qualitative behaviours do you think a reward designer who came up with this reward function is trying to incentivise?

3. What kinds of qualitative behaviours maximise return subject to this reward function? Are they the same as the previous answer?

<details>
<summary>Answers (1 and 2)</summary>

1. The reward function assigns reward 1 to transitions in which the robot picks up a pile of shards, and transitions in which it drops a pile of shards into the bin. (It assigns reward 2 if both of these happen in one transition, but that's impossible, since `PICKUP` and `PUTDOWN` are different actions.)

2. The reward designer is probably trying to incentivise the agent to operate the robot to pick up shards and put them into the bin, 'cleaning up' the pottery shop.

3. No spoilers yet — train the agent below and see for yourself!

## Reinforcement learning

Next, let's apply a reinforcement learning algorithm to see what behaviours the agent learns given this reward function.

<details>
<summary>How are we training the agent? (Optional) </summary>
The provided module `part6_goalmisgen/ppo.py` implements a function `ppo_train_step` that collects some rollouts and trains an agent network on these using a reinforcement learning algorithm — a simplified form of the proximal policy optimisation algorithm you implemented in [2.3] (GAE advantages, the clipped-surrogate objective, several epochs of minibatch updates per batch of rollouts, and rollouts collected by a compiled CUDA-graph step when a GPU is available). All of its hyperparameters have sensible defaults tuned for today's environments, so the training loops below only pass the network, environment, reward function and optimiser. You're welcome to read it, but you don't need to: today it's just infrastructure.
</details>

Here is a function that wraps `ppo_train_step` into a training loop, with a live plot
for various stats like loss and average return while the agent is training.

## Cleaning up shop

Let's use this training loop to train a policy.

1. We'll need a neural network parametrisation of a policy we can train by gradient descent. The provided `ActorCriticNetwork` (see `part6_goalmisgen/agent.py`) is a small residual CNN over the observation grid with separate **actor** and **critic** heads: the actor provides 
a logit vector across actions, from which we can recover a policy, and the critic estimates the value of the current state, which is useful to help stability of training.

2. We'll then call the training function with this network, your manually-instantiated environment from section 1, and the above reward function.

Training takes well under a minute on a Colab GPU.

The next task is to study the behaviour of the agent we learned, and see to what extent it matches the behaviour we intended or expected when we designed this reward function. The following code samples and animates a trajectory from the learned network. Your task is to run the code and study the policy, discerning if there are any differences between:

1. The behaviour the designer of the reward function likely intended;
2. The behaviour you expected after studying the reward function; and
3. The actual behaviour observed.

Note: Change the seed below to see trajectories with different random results when sampling actions from the policy.

Questions:

1. What qualitative behaviours do you observe?

2. Are there discrepancies between the behaviour you observe and the intended/expected behaviour? If so, list them.

> **Note: Finish the previous exercise before reading further.**

If all has gone to plan, you should be looking at an example of specification gaming (also known as reward hacking), in which the reinforcement learning algorithm found a better way to increase expected return than the class of valid solutions the reward designer had in mind.

The two kinds of discrepancies we expect to see in this example are:

1. The agent prefers to repeatedly pick up and drop shards compared to picking them up once and taking them to the bin; and
2. The agent is willing to break urns to find new shards to pick up.

<details>
<summary> Why are these behaviours incentivised? </summary>
Each pickup is worth `+1`, dropping shards on the floor costs nothing, 
and a broken urn is just a fresh supply of shards to farm pickups from. 
Depending on your layout and the randomness of training, the second behaviour may 
be less prominent in the final policy than the first: once the agent has found a 
pile of shards to farm with pickup-drop cycles, it never 
*needs* to break an urn. But notice that nothing in `reward1` 
discourages urn-breaking either: the agent smashes through any urns 
on its path with total indifference, and we'd certainly rather it didn't.
</details>

In this section, we will redesign the reward function to prevent these unintended behaviours from being incentivised.

## The inverse reward hypothesis

Recall the reward hypothesis from above. While this hypothesis is usually invoked in the context of designing an agent using reinforcement learning by identifying an appropriate reward, it applies more broadly as stated.

In particular, the reward hypothesis applies to the behaviour of existing agents. Suppose we have a system that is exhibiting some sort of coherent behaviour. Then (by the reward hypothesis), that behaviour can be well thought of as maximising expected return for *some* reward function.

One could call the above corollary the **inverse reward hypothesis,** following [Stuart Russell (1998)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/279943.279964), also [Andrew Ng and Stuart Russell (2000)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645529.657801), who introduced the problem of *inverse reinforcement learning* (that of taking a policy and extracting from it a reward function for which that policy maximises expected return). 


Caveat: For any policy $\pi$, the
constant zero reward $R_0(s,a,s') = 0$ trivially has the property that $\pi$ maximises expected return for $R_0$. What we would really desire is something more specific: a reward function $R_\pi$ such that $\pi$ maximises expected return for $R_\pi$, but other policies do not.

### Exercise - write reward functions as behavioural probes

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵
> 
> You should spend up to 15-25 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

We won't trouble ourselves with inverse reinforcement learning algorithms today. Instead, let's just take a step in this direction by quantifying the misbehaviour of our agents using reward functions that incentivise each problematic behaviour. We won't use these reward functions for training, but we can use them to measure to what extent we are inadvertently training for these behaviours.

Your next task is to write one reward function that measures the extent to which an agent is engaging in each problematic behaviour:

1. First, write a reward function `reward_drop` that assigns `+1` every time the agent drops a shard (other than in the bin).
2. Second, write a reward function `reward_break` that assigns `+1` every time the agent breaks an urn.

> Remember that these functions operate on *batched* transitions and should return one reward per 
> transition (look back at `reward1` for the idiom). There are a couple of ways to implement each 
> of these, since the information is redundantly represented across the state, action, and 
> next state: any correct implementation is fine.

<details>
<summary>Hint for <code>reward_drop</code>?</summary>

A drop (outside the bin) happens exactly when: 
* the robot is not at the bin position, and 
* the cell below the robot is empty (otherwise `PUTDOWN` does nothing), and
* the robot is holding shards, and 
* the action is `PUTDOWN`. 

All four of these conditions are functions of `state` and `action` alone.

To compare positions per-environment, the boolean 
`(state.robot_pos != state.bin_pos).any(dim=-1)` is true if either the x or y coordinates of
the robot and the bin don't match i.e. the robot is not at the bin.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint for <code>reward_break</code>?</summary>

An urn breaks exactly when the robot's *new* position (i.e. `next_state.robot_pos`) 
is a cell that contained an urn *before* the transition and contains shards *after* it. 
You can gather the item at the robot's new position from both `state.items_map` 
and `next_state.items_map`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Help! I'm having trouble with the batched indexing for <code>reward_break</code>?</summary>

The thing you want is a vector of the item beneath the robot, batched across each parallel
environment i.e. a vector `item_below_robot : (B,)` such that

```python
item_below_robot[b] = state.items_map[b, next_state.robot_pos[b, 0], next_state.robot_pos[b, 1]]
```
for each environment `b`.

We could of course do this as a loop:
```python
num_envs = state.inventory.shape[0]
item_below_robot = torch.empty(num_envs)
for b in range(num_envs):
    item_below_robot[b] = state.items_map[b, next_state.robot_pos[b, 0], next_state.robot_pos[b, 1]]
```

but this can be slow for a large number of environments, and is not
something that we can accelerate with a GPU.

We can achieve this batched indexing with the following code:
```python
batch = t.arange(state.inventory.shape[0], device=state.inventory.device)
item_below_robot = state.items_map[
    batch,
    next_state.robot_pos[:, 0],
    next_state.robot_pos[:, 1],
]
```
which is a standard idiom for batched indexing.
Note that 

```python
batch = t.arange(state.inventory.shape[0], device=state.inventory.device)
item_below_robot = state.items_map[
    :,
    next_state.robot_pos[:, 0],
    next_state.robot_pos[:, 1],
]
```
is **NOT** the same thing, because it will instead collect
```python
item_below_robot[b] = state.items_map[:, next_state.robot_pos[b, 0], next_state.robot_pos[b, 1]]
```
for each environment `b`, forming a matrix of shape `(B, B)` of which
the diagonal is what you actually wanted.

## Quantifying reward hacking

Having written these reward functions, we can get a quantitative 
signal about whether our policy is engaging in these misbehaviours. 
We can collect a batch of trajectories and then score them according 
to each reward function and plot the result, using the following 
convenience function (from `part6_goalmisgen/evaluation.py`):

```python
def evaluate_behaviour(
    env: Environment,
    net: ActorCriticNetwork,
    reward_fn: RewardFunction,
    num_steps: int = 64,
    num_rollouts: int = 1000,
    discount_rate: float = 0.995,
    generator: torch.Generator | None = None,
) -> Float[Tensor, "num_rollouts"]
```

Note that, unlike a reward function that correctly incentivises 
the *intended* behaviour, we ideally want these reward functions 
*to be minimised.* Moreover, note that to tell if a reward function 
is minimised or maximised, we need to consider the range of possible 
returns, which depends on the reward function (in these simple 
environments it can be derived analytically).

## Potential shaping: avoiding cycles

Regarding the first problematic behaviour (repeatedly picking up and dropping shards), one solution would be to remove the reward for picking up shards altogether. The intention is for the shards to end up in the bin, not in the inventory for their own sake, anyway.

However, sometimes rewarding instrumental goals can assist the agent's learning process. When we know that something is instrumentally useful for achieving a task, it would be nice if we could incorporate that knowledge into the reward.

The only problem is that incorporating these kinds of hints into the reward is a delicate operation: as we have seen, it can lead to misspecification and reward hacking if it becomes possible to satisfy the hint without completing the original task! We want the shaped reward to provide extra feedback to the agent to help it learn the desired behaviour, rather than changing the behaviour that the reward function selects for.

Fortunately, there is a sure-fire scheme for adding a so-called 
**shaping** term to a reward function without introducing 
such exploits. This is called
**potential shaping,** and it works as follows:

1. Formulate the information as a (bounded) function of states, $\Phi : S \to \mathbb{R}$, called a potential function.
2. When we transition from state $s$ to state $s'$, add reward $\gamma \Phi(s')$ to represent gaining the potential from being in state $s'$, but also *subtract* reward $\Phi(s)$ to represent *losing* the potential from *leaving* state $s$.
3. This helps the agent learn to steer towards states with 'high potential', without giving it a long-term incentive to stay there for the sake of this potential — the potential should eventually either be lost (if the agent leaves those states without achieving return) or actualised (if the policy leaves the states and gains actual reward).

### Exercise (optional) - prove that potentials cancel

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪
> 
> This is a theoretical exercise; skip it if you prefer to keep coding.
> ```

Let 

* $\Phi : S \to \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded potential function, 
* $R : S \times A \times S \to \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded reward function, and 
* $\gamma \in (0,1)$ a discount rate. 

Define a shaped reward function $R' : S \times A \times S \to \mathbb{R}$ 
such that for all triples $s,a,s'$ we have
$$
R'(s,a,s') = R(s,a,s') + \gamma\Phi(s') - \Phi(s).
$$

Given a trajectory $s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \ldots$, calculate the return under the two reward functions $R$ and $R'$ and show that they differ by an additive constant that depends only on $s_0$.

Conclude that the ordering on policies induced by the expected return under $R$ is the same as the ordering on policies induced by the expected return under $R'$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Let $R$ denote the return with respect to reward function $r$, and $R'$ the return with respect to reward function $r'$. Then:

$$
\begin{align*}
  R'(s_0, a_0, \ldots)
  &= \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R'(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})
\\
  &= \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t (
      R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) + \gamma\Phi(s_{t+1}) - \Phi(s_t)
  )
\\
  &= \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})
  + \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^{t+1} \Phi(s_{t+1})
  - \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t \Phi(s_t)
\\
  &= R(s_0, a_0, \ldots)
  + \sum_{t=1}^\infty \gamma^t \Phi(s_t)
  - \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t \Phi(s_t)
\\
  &= R(s_0, a_0, \ldots) - \Phi(s_0).
\end{align*}
$$

It follows that (writing $\iota$ for the environment's initial state distribution and $\tau$ for its transition distribution)

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \mathbb{E} \left[
    R'(s_0, a_0, \ldots)
    \mid s_0 \sim \iota,
    a_t \sim \pi(s_t),
    s_{t+1} \sim \tau(s_t, a_t)
  \right] \\
  &=
  \mathbb{E} \left[
    R(s_0, a_0, \ldots) - \Phi(s_0)
    \mid s_0 \sim \iota,
    a_t \sim \pi(s_t),
    s_{t+1} \sim \tau(s_t, a_t)
  \right]
\\
  &=
  \mathbb{E} \left[
    R(s_0, a_0, \ldots)
    \mid  s_0 \sim \iota,
    a_t \sim \pi(s_t),
    s_{t+1} \sim \tau(s_t, a_t)
  \right] -
  \mathbb{E} \left[
    \Phi(s_0) \mid s_0 \sim \iota
  \right].
\end{align*}
$$

That is, for all policies $\pi$, the expected return under $R$ and $R'$ differs by a fixed constant (independent of $\pi$). So the two expected returns induce the same ordering on policies, and in particular have the same maximisers.

<summary>Discussion - what does shaping do here?</summary>

The effect of shaping is to transform a reward function that only gives reward when the robot drops a shard into the bin into a reward function that gets this reward in advance and then loses small amounts of reward while it is holding the shard until it drops it into the bin, so that after discounting, the total return after dropping the shard into the bin is equal. If the robot drops the shard on the floor, it loses the initial reward that was advanced.

In particular, a pickup-then-drop cycle now yields exactly zero discounted return: the loophole that `reward1` left open is now no longer available for the agent to abuse.

## Disincentivising specific behaviours

Let's turn to the second problematic behaviour: breaking urns to find more shards. There are a couple of different approaches to disincentivising this behaviour. We'll use a simple approach of directly penalising transitions in which the robot breaks an urn.

The main question is, how much of a negative reward should we assign for breaking an urn?

* We need to set the negative reward large enough so that the agent is better off *not* breaking the urn rather than breaking the urn and binning the resulting shards.
* We can't set the negative reward to be too large, or it will cause training instability.

You can try different values, but a good default value would be -2 reward for breaking an urn. The agent can recover 1 reward later if it bins the shards created by breaking the urn (the gain in return will be slightly less than 1 due to discounting). Penalising -2 means the agent is clearly better off not breaking the urn.

### Exercise (optional) - everyone has a price

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪
> 
> This is an optional thought experiment; skip it if you're short on time.
> ```

If you have time, consider the following two questions:

1. If the reward for breaking an urn is -2, there are still situations in which breaking an urn can lead to higher return than not breaking an urn. Can you find any such situations?

2. Can you think of any approach to defining a reward function that would make breaking urns always suboptimal?

<details>
<summary>Hint (question 1)</summary>

Think about *discounting*, and about urns that stand between the robot and something valuable. A penalty received far in the future is discounted; what does that imply about a penalty received *now* versus rewards unlocked sooner?

</details>

<details>
<summary> Solution (question 1) </summary>

First, note that breaking an urn just to clean up *its own* shards is never worth it.
Under `reward2` (potential $\Phi$ = 0.5, bin reward +1), the best possible break→pickup→bin
sequence (break at t=0, pickup at t=1, bin at the earliest possible step k ≥ 2) earns

$$
\underbrace{-2}_{\text{penalty}} \;+\; \underbrace{0.5\,\gamma\cdot\gamma}_{\text{pickup shaping}} \;+\; \underbrace{0.5\,\gamma^{k}}_{\text{bin: }+1-0.5\text{ lost potential}}
\;=\; -2 + 0.5\gamma^2 + 0.5\gamma^k \;\le\; -2 + \gamma^2 \;\approx\; -1.01 .
$$

It is *comfortably negative* (≈ −1), because the penalty (−2) is **twice** the most a single
bin reward can ever return (+1), and discounting only shrinks the recovery further. So a
one-shard break clearly never pays: this is exactly the 2:1 safety margin the −2 was chosen
for.

Breaking *can* pay only when it unlocks **more than two bin-rewards' worth** of otherwise-lost
or heavily-delayed value — this is what the discounting hint points at. Imagine an urn (or a
wall of urns) penning several shards into a corner, so that the only alternative is a long
detour. Not breaking delays *every* future delivery, and each step of delay is discounted;
break it once (−2, paid now) and all those rewards arrive sooner. If the urn gates K future
deliveries that each save D steps, breaking is worth it roughly when

$$
\sum_{\text{deliveries}} \gamma^{t}\,(1-\gamma^{D}) \;>\; 2 .
$$

On the small open grids here you can step around any single urn in a cell or two (D is tiny),
so this almost never fires — you have to *construct* an adversarial layout (a large grid, a
barrier of urns, many shards behind it) to make breaking strictly return-maximising.

**A concrete layout.** A tall wall of urns separates the robot+bin (top-left) from a stash of
shards (top-right); the only gap is at the far bottom corner, so the honest route is a long
detour, while smashing *one* urn opens a near corridor that every delivery reuses:

```python
env_price = Environment(
    init_robot_pos=t.tensor((0, 1), dtype=t.long),
    init_items_map=t.tensor(
        (
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1),   # bin (0,0); urn wall in col 3; shards top-right
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),   # gap at (7,3): the only way around the wall
        ),
        dtype=t.long,
    ),
    bin_pos=t.tensor((0, 0), dtype=t.long),
)
```

**Checking the two strategies.** We plan each strategy with breadth-first search, roll it
through the *real* environment, and score every transition with `reward2` (so the −2 penalty,
the shaping, and discounting are all exactly as the agent would see them):

detour = discounted_return(plan(blocked=URNS))                      # never break: use the bottom gap
smash = max(discounted_return(plan(blocked=URNS - {u})) for u in URNS)  # break the single best urn
print(f"detour {detour:+.3f}   smash {smash:+.3f}")  # -> detour +1.189   smash +1.356
```

The smash route wins: **+1.36 vs +1.19**. The detour is so long that within the 64-step horizon
it only manages to bin **one** shard, whereas breaking one urn (paying −2 once) lets the agent
bin **four** — the discounting saved on those extra deliveries more than covers the penalty. So
yes: **even with the −2 penalty, breaking the urn is return-maximising here.**

**Do we expect a *trained* agent to break it?** Not necessarily — and that's the punchline.
Training PPO in this layout (`train_agent(env_price, ..., reward_fn=reward2)`) at 512–2048 steps
across several seeds, the agent learns **nothing**: it never bins, and never breaks (reward2,
reward_break, reward_bin all ≈ 0). The optimum requires a long, precisely-sequenced manoeuvre
(cross the wall → reach a far shard → carry it all the way back → bin, ×5), and the −2 is an
*immediate, salient* deterrent against the very first step of that plan, while its payoff is
distant and only reached by a lucky exploration sequence. So *return-maximisation* says "break",
but the *optimiser* never gets there. The lesson: a behaviour being incentivised by the reward
(highest return) is necessary but **not sufficient** for an RL agent to actually exhibit it — you
might also need exploration help (distance-based shaping, a curriculum, or more training) before
the agent's "price" actually gets paid.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Solution (question 2) </summary>

The cleanest fix is to make the penalty larger than the **most return a broken urn could
ever unlock**. In a *bounded* world (finite grid, finite shards, so the total achievable
discounted return is some $R_{\max}$), any penalty $\ge R_{\max}$ guarantees breaking can
never be compensated — even a perfect shortcut to the entire rest of the shop can't recover
more than $R_{\max}$. In practice you don't need to go that far: any penalty strictly larger
than the per-urn recoverable value plus the largest shortcut saving will do. The catch (and
the reason this is a *thought* experiment) is the trade-off the section already flagged: a
very large penalty causes training instability and can make the agent over-cautious, refusing
useful paths near urns.

A tempting wrong answer is "add a potential for intact urns". This does **not** work:
potential shaping is *policy-invariant* (it leaves the ordering over policies unchanged — you
proved this in the optional exercise above), so it cannot make breaking suboptimal if it
wasn't already. Discouraging a behaviour fundamentally requires changing the reward's
preferences (a penalty), or changing the environment (e.g. making urns impassable), not a
shaping term.

Your next task is to bring together the previous exercises to eliminate specification gaming:

2. Train a new network, using the same environment, agent architecture, and hyperparameters as last time, but this time using the new reward function 
    * we recommend `num_train_steps=192` this time, since the shaped reward takes a little longer to master.


3. Inspect some rollouts, manually and/or by using your evaluation reward function probes, to confirm that the agent now behaves as intended.

# 4️⃣ Generalisation
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: markdown
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

r'''
So far, we have worked with a specific grid-world layout. In practice, we want our agents to be able to navigate and complete tasks in complex environments, up to and including the real world.

Real-world environments are almost infinitely complex: an agent will almost never see the same situation more than once. This means we could never hope to give our agents direct experience in every possible state they might encounter prior to deployment.

Instead, we need to train agents that will **generalise** from the situations they encountered during training to the new situations they will face after deployment.

In this section, we'll investigate a more complex version of our pottery shop environment where the same agent might face different shop layouts.

## Generalisation in RL

Generalisation is a foundational concept in machine learning. In reinforcement learning, generalisation is essentially no different:

* We want a function. In this case, it's a function called a 'policy' and it maps from states/observations to action probabilities.

* We use deep learning to learn that function from data. The details here are a little different in reinforcement learning than in supervised learning, but at the end of the day, we are still using a gradient descent algorithm to find weights that optimise some objective. In this case, the objective is derived from maximising expected return.

* We haven't explored all possible inputs to the function. There are some states for which the policy's outputs have never been queried and subjected to calibration through the objective.

Generalisation in reinforcement learning refers to how the policy responds to unseen states, particularly whether the action probabilities that it outputs for these states are consistent with the training objective of maximising expected return.

> ```yaml

Let's see how your policy generalises:

1. Design a new instance of the pottery shop environment where the robot and items spawn in new positions. The world size should be the same as before, as the network architecture assumes this shape.
2. Without training in this new environment, generate and plot some rollouts from your previously-trained agent `net2` in this new environment.
3. Inspect the behaviour of the agent and qualitatively describe it.

<summary>Solution (example layout)</summary>

Many altered environment layouts are permissible. Here is one in which the shards and urns have been interchanged:

```python
env2 = Environment(
    init_robot_pos=t.tensor((3, 4), dtype=t.long),
    init_items_map=t.tensor(
        (
            (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1),
            (0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1),
            (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            (0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1),
            (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1),
            (1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1),
        ),
        dtype=t.long,
    ),
    bin_pos=t.tensor((0, 0), dtype=t.long),
)

rollout = collect_rollout(
    env=env2,
    policy_fn=net2.policy,
    num_steps=64,
    generator=t.Generator().manual_seed(1),
    device=device,
)
display_rollout(env2, rollout)
```

You will most likely find that the policy does *not* clean up the new shop: it was trained in a single fixed layout, so it has had no pressure to attend to where the shards actually are — it can simply memorise a trajectory. (It often does *worse* than nothing here, walking its memorised route into urns and dropping shards on the floor.)

## Procedurally generated environments

In most cases, training a policy in a fixed environment will cause the agent to learn a brittle policy that relies on many assumptions about the environment that happen to hold in the fixed environment.

A common approach to learning more robust policies is to train the agent in a broad distribution of *procedurally generated* environments, all of which share some commonality (e.g. same world size) but do not allow the agent to rely on spurious assumptions (e.g. robot and item positions). Otherwise the agent will not learn to identify where 
the items are, but just memorize the trajectory that obtains high return.

<details>
<summary> Examples of generalisation problems </summary>

This is a common problem in Reinforcement Learning: [CartPole](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/), a classic RL control problem about
teaching the agent to balance an inverted pendulum. 
The state space is given by $(x, \dot{x}, \theta, \dot{\theta})$, the cart position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity respectively, which fully describes the 
instantaneous state of the system.

The starting state is $(x, \dot{x}, \theta, \dot{\theta}) = (0,0,0,0)$, i.e. the cart is centered and stationary, and the pole is vertical and stationary.
The environment then injects a small amount of uniformly
sampled noise $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{U}(-0.05, 0.05)$ to each of the state variables, 
to prevent the agent from learning a policy that just memorises a sequence of
actions that works only for the starting state, but is brittle and fails under
any slight perturbation (i.e. the cart can't correct itself back to vertical 
if you poke it a little).

Another approach to preventing memorization used for the 
[Atari Learning Environment (ALE)](https://ale.farama.org/environments/) (a class
of environments that are video games for the Atari 2600 console) 
is to add noise to the actions: when the agent attempts to execute 
some action $a_{t}$, there is a small probability that the previous action
$a_{t-1}$ is executed instead, as if the buttons on the joystick were
sticky. This method injects noise without changing the game dynamics, which
isn't always so easy (ALE games are literally ROM files running on
an emulator of the original hardware, so it would be non-trivial to
adjust the game mechanics directly).

</details>


The first step to such a training approach is to write some code to randomly generate variations of the environment. Take a look at the following example. 
It generates a whole *batch* of environments at once, and 
for each environment in the batch, it places the bin in the top-left corner, then samples distinct cells for the robot and each item by taking the first few entries of a random permutation of the remaining grid cells.

(Don't worry if you can't fully understand the code here, we will just be making
use of it to generate environments for training.)

## Training on a distribution of environments

Once we have a distribution of environments, we can integrate it into a reinforcement learning algorithm by, for example, sampling a new batch of environments for every batch of rollouts we collect. The provided `ppo_train_step_multienv` does exactly this: it's the same PPO step as before, except that instead of collecting all rollouts from one environment, it collects one rollout from each environment in a batch. Here is a modified version of `train_agent` that takes a procedural environment generator rather than a single environment.

Once `net3` finishes training, your task is to explore its generalisation properties:

1. Design some different shop layouts (with `world_size=4`) to probe the agent's generalisation properties.

2. For each shop layout you design, predict how you think the agent will behave.

3. Then manually inspect the agent's behaviour using `collect_rollout` and `display_rollout`.

4. Qualitatively characterise the kinds of environments where the agent generalises correctly and the ones where it does not.


Think carefully about what was constant across every 
environment the agent ever trained in. These are the kinds of things that
if varied, the agent may fail to generalise to.

> ⚠️ Don't read on to section 5 until you've found at least one layout where the agent

The agent generalises well across layouts that look like training layouts: new robot/item positions, and even new item counts, are usually handled correctly (shards get picked up and carried to the top-left corner, and urns are mostly avoided).

The most interesting probe is moving the *bin*. In every training environment, the bin was in the top-left corner. If you place the bin somewhere else (e.g. the top-right corner, as in the example layout above), you should observe that the agent still capably picks up shards and carries them to the **top-left corner**: where it drops them on the floor, ignoring the actual bin. The next section is about exactly this phenomenon.

> ⚠️ **Make sure you have finished the previous section before reading further.**

If all has gone to plan, you should have found at least one example of goal misgeneralisation. Let's move forward with the following example. When the policy is tested on environment layouts where the bin is outside of the corner, we expect to see the following:

1. the policy generalises in terms of its ability to pick up shards, carry them to a destination, and drop them there; but
2. the policy fails to generalise in terms of its behavioural goal of carrying the shards to the location of the bin.

In this section, we will unpack this example and explore the effect of the procedural environment generator on the way the policy generalises its goal.

### Exercise - elements of goal misgeneralisation

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵
> 
> You should spend up to 20-25 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

Here is an excerpt from 
[Langosco et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14111) where the authors informally
define goal misgeneralisation:


> **2.1 Defining Goal Misgeneralisation** \
> A deep RL agent is trained to maximize reward $R : S \times A \times S \to \mathbb{R}$,
> where $S$ and $A$ are the sets of all valid states and actions, respectively. 
> Assume that the agent is deployed 
> under distributional shift; that is, an aspect of the environment (and therefore the 
> distribution of observations) changes at test time. **Goal misgeneralization** occurs 
> if the agent now achieves low reward in the new environment because it continues to act 
> capably yet appears to optimize a different reward $R' \neq R$. We call $R$ the 
> **intended objective** and $R'$ the **behavioral objective** of the agent.

Your next task is to line up the elements of this definition with our case of goal misgeneralisation:

1. What is the distribution shift? Provide an example of an environment from the test distribution, `env_shift` (you can use one of the environments you designed for the previous exercise).
2. What is the behavioural objective in this case? Identify it and then write a reward function `proxy` that encodes this behaviour.
3. Use `evaluate_behaviour` and the histogram code from section 3 to show that the policy achieves low return under the training reward function but high return under the behavioural objective in `env_shift`.

<summary>Solution (discussion)</summary>

1. **The distribution shift:** during training, the bin was *always* in the top-left corner `(0, 0)`; at test time, the bin is somewhere else. The example `env_shift` we
suggest above has the bin in the top-right corner.

2. **The behavioural objective:** "carry shards to the top-left corner and drop them there". During training, this objective and the intended objective ("carry shards to the bin") were perfectly correlated: the policy had no way to distinguish them, and the simpler/more learnable one won out. The `proxy` reward function above encodes it: `+1` for dropping shards at `(0, 0)` when it isn't the bin, and `0` otherwise.


3. The histograms should show the policy achieving *much lower* return under `reward2` than it does in-distribution (it almost never actually bins anything in `env_shift`) while scoring solidly positive return under `proxy`: the agent is still competently optimising *something*, it's just not the thing we trained for.


</details>

Note: We call the behavioural objective `proxy` because it's correlated with the training reward function on the training environment distribution.


<details>
<summary> Discussion on goal misgeneralisation </summary>
There would be no way to tell apart two agents, one of which that has learned
the behavioural objective, and one that has learned the intended objective,
without either some sort of white-box method that allows us to examine
the internals of the model to see what the agent is optimising for, or by observing
the behaviour of the agents on out-of-distribution environments. Here, it's quite
easy to infer what the out-of-distribution behaviour might be, but in general
this is an open problem, as it's not a priori always clear what out-of-distribution
might look like. A sufficiently capable agent that is aware that it is in training
might deliberately sandbag or act in accordance with the intended objective
to prevent being updated by training dynamics, and then pursue its own goals
once in deployment. [Anthropic observed this phenomenon in 2024.](https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking)

### Exercise - implement the distribution shift

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

In the previous two exercises, you manually generated environment layouts in which the policy misgeneralises.

Your next task is to automate the construction of these environments by writing a new procedural environment generator that samples from a broader distribution of environments.

In particular, write a function `generate_shift`, a modification of `generate` from above, that randomises not only the item and robot spawn locations, but also the bin location.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

An easy way to do this is to incorporate the bin placement into the same without-replacement sample as the robot and the other items: permute *all* `world_size**2` cells (don't reserve cell 0), and use the first sampled cell for the bin, the second for the robot, and the rest for the items.

## Training out of distribution

In principle, an easy way to fix goal misgeneralisation is to train a policy in a broader distribution of levels, like that generated by `generate_shift` as opposed to `generate`. If we train a new policy using this new environment generator, we should see goal misgeneralisation decrease. This task is harder than the last one (the agent now has to *find* the bin rather than always heading for the corner): expect the return to sit near zero for the first ~100 steps before climbing sharply. If your return curve hasn't taken off by the end, train for another hundred steps or so before drawing conclusions.

## Mitigating goal misgeneralisation in practice

In practice, we might want to prevent goal misgeneralisation in a situation where:

1. We only have access to a given distribution of environments analogous to `generate`;
2. We face some unknown distribution shift in deployment, analogous to evaluating in environments sampled from `generate_shift`; but
3. *We don't have access to `generate_shift` during training!*

In this case, the simple solution of just training in environments from `generate_shift` might not be available. Finding ways to mitigate this kind of goal misgeneralisation is an active research area.

## Conclusion

Hopefully you have gained an appreciation for the relationship between a designer's intention, a reward function, and a policy's behaviour in reinforcement learning:

* **Goal misspecification/reward hacking/outer alignment failure**: In training environments, if there are behaviours that score higher return than the designer's intended behaviours according to the reward function, then the policy will pursue those instead.
* **Goal misgeneralisation/inner alignment failure**: In out-of-distribution environments, the behaviour of the policy is not necessarily determined by what the reward function *would have* incentivised: rather it comes down to the inductive biases of the agent architecture. A goal that is "simpler", that perfectly correlated with
the intended goal during training, will be the same goal that the policy will
continue to pursue later in environments where the intended goal, and the learned goal,
diverge.

Suggestions for further exploration, in rough order of effort:

* **Everyone has a price, revisited.** If you skipped the optional exercise in section 3, go back to it: find a concrete layout in which breaking an urn is *return-maximising* even under `reward2`, and verify your prediction by training an agent in that layout. Can you design a reward function under which breaking urns is always suboptimal, no matter the layout?

<details>
<summary>Solution (the optimal policy breaks the wall — but RL struggles to push past the penalty to learn it)</summary>

The cleanest version isn't a *detour* at all — it's an **impassable wall**. Seal a large pile of
shards behind a full column of urns with no gap, so the shards are simply *unreachable* unless the
robot smashes through:

```python
# Column 3 is urns top-to-bottom (no gap); a 3x3 pile of shards is sealed behind it.
env_wall = Environment(
    init_robot_pos=t.tensor((3, 1), dtype=t.long),
    init_items_map=t.tensor(
        (
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
        ),
        dtype=t.long,
    ),
    bin_pos=t.tensor((0, 0), dtype=t.long),
)
```

Reusing the BFS-and-roll comparison from the section-3 "everyone has a price" solution (just swap
`env_price` → `env_wall`) gives:

```
reachable shards WITHOUT breaking: 0/9
DO NOT BREAK : discounted reward2 = +0.000
BREAK 1 urn  : discounted reward2 = +1.416   (broke (0, 3))
```

**In theory, the optimal policy smashes the wall.** Breaking is *unambiguously* return-maximising
here — it is the *only* way to obtain any reward at all, so any pile big enough to recover more than
the one-off −2 makes smashing worth it. (This is also why **question 2 is impossible with a fixed
penalty**: put enough shards behind the wall and the recoverable return exceeds *any* finite penalty,
so no constant urn-break cost can make breaking universally suboptimal — you'd need a penalty that
scales with what's reachable, or to change the dynamics so urns are genuinely impassable.)

**In practice, a trained agent never learns to.** Train PPO in this layout —
`train_agent(env_wall, net, reward_fn=reward2, num_train_steps=...)` — and across seeds and training
lengths (512–2048 steps) the agent learns **nothing**: `reward2`, `reward_break`, and `reward_bin`
all stay ≈ 0. The obstacle is precisely the **negative reinforcement of breaking urns**. To reach the
reward, the agent has to do the one thing the reward function actively punishes — pay the −2 to crack
the wall — *before* any of the +1 payoff behind it is even reachable. So a `−2` "moat" of negative
reward surrounds the door: gradient descent feels that immediate penalty long before it could ever
feel the distant shards, and the policy settles into the safe local optimum of *never touching an urn*
(and, here, doing nothing at all). The agent would have to push *through* a stretch of guaranteed
negative reinforcement to discover the large reward on the far side, and PPO's local, reward-following
updates won't take that bet.

So the global optimum ("smash through, then clean the pile") genuinely exists, but it sits behind a
barrier of negative reward that ordinary RL won't cross without help — distance-based shaping, a
curriculum, intrinsic-motivation / exploration bonuses, or simply spawning the agent behind the wall.
Takeaway: **being incentivised by the reward (highest return) is necessary but not sufficient for an
RL agent to exhibit a behaviour — it also has to be reachable without first wading through a
penalty the optimiser is busy learning to avoid.**

</details>

* **Break the agent.** Our `reward2` agent clears essentially the whole shop in the fixed layout. The trainer in `part6_goalmisgen/ppo.py` gets there by reusing each batch of rollouts for several epochs of minibatch updates with a fairly high learning rate (see its defaults). Pass `num_epochs=1, num_minibatches=1` and/or a learning rate of `0.001` to `ppo_train_step` and retrain: how many piles does the agent clean now, and how much longer does it take? (A single update per batch and lr 0.001 typically gets stuck cleaning one pile.)

* **Other shaping potentials.** The inventory potential is the simplest useful potential. Try a distance-based potential (e.g. negative distance from the robot to the nearest shards while empty-handed, or to the bin while loaded). Does it speed up learning? Does it stay un-hackable, as the theory guarantees?

* **Partial shift.** Instead of training on `generate_shift` (bin anywhere), try training on a distribution where the bin appears in *two* of the four corners. How does the policy generalise to the other two corners? What does this tell you about the inductive biases of the network?

* **Measure misgeneralisation as a function of diversity.** Sweep the fraction of training environments that come from `generate_shift` vs `generate` (e.g. 0%, 1%, 10%, 50%), and plot the proxy return on shifted environments as a function of this fraction. How much diversity is enough?

* **Read the literature.** [Langosco et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14111) and [Shah et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01790) catalogue goal misgeneralisation examples (the CoinRun example is a direct big sibling of our bin-in-the-corner example); [Krakovna et al.'s specification gaming list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml) is a fun collection of real-world reward hacks ([blog post](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity/)); and [Ng, Harada & Russell (1999)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/icml99-shaping.pdf) is the original potential shaping paper, proving that potential shaping is the *only* form of shaping that never changes the optimal policy.

* **Competence is not alignment** Write a probe `reward_pickup` that scores +1 whenever the robot picks up a pile of shards (regardless of where it later drops them), and use evaluate_behaviour to show that under the bin-moved shift, net3 keeps `reward_pickup` HIGH (it is still a competent shard-collector) even as `reward2` collapses.
