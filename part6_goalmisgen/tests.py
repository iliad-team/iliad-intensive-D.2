Tests for [2.6] Specification Gaming & Goal Misgeneralisation.

Each test takes the student's function as an argument and checks it against
hand-computed ground truth on small, hand-constructed pottery shop
transitions. Transitions are generated with the real `Environment.step` so
that any correct implementation (whether it inspects `state` and `action`, or
`next_state`) gives the same answers.
