"""
Evaluating agent behaviour with reward functions, in batched PyTorch.

A PyTorch port of the JAX original by Matthew Farrugia-Roberts
(https://github.com/matomatical/reward-lab).

A `RewardFunction` maps a *batch* of transitions to a batch of scalar
rewards: it takes a batched `State` (fields with leading dimension B), a
batched action (int[B]), and a batched next state, and returns float[B].
